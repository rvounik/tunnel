  # tunnel
  
  javascript tunnel effect that mimics a well-known demoscene routine
  
  run it from your local web server or straight in the browser
  
  ![Alt text](/img/screenshot.png?raw=true "screenshot")
  
features:

- Utilises Createjs library for reasons unknown
- Can be configured to run in 1x1, 2x2 etc. pixel mode
- This time round I did borrow the theory from someone else

Note that it is still quite heavy on resources
